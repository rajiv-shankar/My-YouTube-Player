This maximizes the YouTube video screen size without going Full Screen
(leaving minimal space for an input field for entering the video code).
This is larger than the Theater Mode available on YouTube itself
(and even e.g. Cinema Mode in 'Enhancer for YouTube' extension).
This helps esp. while watching coding video tutorials
where the code is otherwise hard to read on a small laptop (e.g. 13" MBP).

(To minimize the 'app' there are no external css & js files.)
